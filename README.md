# EnduranceAlchemy

Endurance Alchemy is a sole-proprietorship through which I conduct several projects including the development of a cutting-edge website designed to help coaches, at any level, to train their endurance athletes effectively and with much less time-intensive preparations before practice time. Endurance Alchemy also facilitates detailed record keeping on every athlete so the coach can track their fitness and prescribe the right workout every time. The website is currently being upgraded in order to become even more precise and user-friendly than before and to encompass a greater range of running events. It will go "live" at a date to be announced some time in the future. Endurance Alchemy is also the vehicle through which I am developing a low-cost impact reducing device, intended for use as an inexpensive rehabilitation tool for athletes who have experienced injury.
